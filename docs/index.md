# Complex Valued Neural Networks

This is a library that uses [pytorch](https://pytorch.org) as a back-end for complex valued neural networks.

It was initially developed by Victor Dhédin and Jérémie Levi during their third year project at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/). 

## Installation

To install the library, it is simple as :

```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/jeremyfix/torchcvnn.git
```
