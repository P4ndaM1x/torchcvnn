Complex Valued Neural Networks
==============================

This is a library that uses `pytorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ as a back-end for complex valued neural networks.

It was initially developed by Victor Dhédin and Jérémie Levi during their third year project at `CentraleSupélec <https://www.centralesupelec.fr/>`_.
